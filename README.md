><br>
>
><h2>Description</h2>
>
>This project is an assignment for beginner programmers and is meant to help them get comfortable with JavaScript programming, DOM manipulation and loops.
>
>The project is a simple one-page JavaScript application which creates a sketch field and "draws" on the field by coloring in divs which make it up when the mouse hovers over it.
>
><br>
>
><h2>Aim</h2>
>Design a simple browser application which creates a fixed-size container wherein different grid-sizes can be applied and wherein the grid-points (made up by divs) are filled with color when the mouse cursor hovers over them.

><h2>Instructions on how to play</h2>
>
>- Once the page has loaded, the page will display four buttons to the left and a sketh-field to the right
>- A default sketch size is already applied and will start coloring divs inside the sketch field with the default color of black when the mouse cursor hovers over it
>- You can change the sketch size by clicking on one of the buttons to the right with options: small, medium & large. Clicking one of these buttons will also cause the color of the divs inside the sketch field to change to a new randomly selected color each time the mouse cursor is hovered over it.
>- To return to the default sketch-field, click on the 'normal' button to the left which will reload the default state, or simply refresh the tab the page is open in.
